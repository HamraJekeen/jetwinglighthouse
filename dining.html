        <h1>DINING</h1>
        <h2>The Ultimate Dining Destination In The South</h2>
        <p>Featuring an exquisite selection of six dining spaces atop our resident coastal hillock, Jetwing Lighthouse is perhaps one of the finest dining destinations to exist on the sunny southern coastline of our tropical isle. In addition, you may indulge in the luxury of choosing between five more Signature Dining experiences as a pleasure of our legendary Sri Lankan hospitality.</p>
        

        <p>  For fine dining, The Cinnamon Room at Jetwing Lighthouse is a magnificent dinner-only restaurant that specialises in a number of seafood delicacies, while the Cardamom Café is a standout among Galle restaurants – operating for 24 hours a day, with a constant flow of food and drink through generous buffets or delicious snacks and refreshments. Our world-renowned executive chef, Nihal Senanayake, also brings his culinary prowess directly to your table at Nihal’s, where each dish has been carefully studied to the extent of its molecular structure to serve you exquisite global cuisine with a signature local touch. Finally, for a taste of Italy on Sri Lankan shores, Jetwing Lighthouse also houses Lorenzo’s Pizza Bar with its wide selection of meat, seafood, vegan, vegetarian and even kids’ pizzas to cater to every palate.</p> 
            
        <p>     
            To wash down your meals in style, Jetwing Lighthouse features a sophisticated watering hole with an extensive range of cocktails, mocktails and everything in between – the Coats of Arms Bar, which is a nostalgic, old-world space with rustic charms to keep you in high spirits till midnight every day.
        </p> 
        <p>  
            Finally, as a speciality of our hospitality, Jetwing Lighthouse offers five distinct Signature Dining experiences if you wish to indulge in your meals with a more personalised touch at a setting of your choosing. Whether you choose to enjoy a BBQ on our rocky shores, treat your loved one to a romantic meal in our gazebo, wake up to a champagne breakfast overlooking the ocean, escape to the privacy of our romantic spa or even to the comforts of your own room, our home of Sri Lankan hospitality looks forward to crafting a truly unique dining experience for you.</p>
