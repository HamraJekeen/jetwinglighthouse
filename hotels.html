                <h1>The Birthplace Of Our Legendary Hospitality</h1>
                <p>Nearly half a century ago, our story began on the quiet northwestern shores of Sri Lanka with a charming home that opened its doors to the world. Rooted in the family values instilled by our late founder, Herbert Cooray, the luxurious comforts of the bygone Blue Oceanic have since transformed into Jetwing Blue. Proudly honoured as the only 5-star property in the area, this original home of Sri Lankan hospitality joins our extended family of hotels in Negombo, including Jetwing Beach and Jetwing Sea which share the same coastal strip, Jetwing Ayurveda Pavilions, which is designed around the practice of our ancient healing science, and Jetwing Lagoon on the outskirts by the magnificent waters that inspired its name. Every member of our family in Negombo offers a holistic holiday experience in Sri Lanka, with indulgent wellness facilities, diverse dining spaces, exciting adventures, and a host of unique modern amenities such as personal butlers, Jacuzzis, and private balconies that overlook the magnificent coastal landscapes of the region.</p>
